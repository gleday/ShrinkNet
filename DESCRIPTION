Description: The present package enables the reconstruction of an undirected network
    that characterizes the conditional independence structure between variables.
    It implements a fast variational algorithm to approximate the posterior distributions
    in the Bayesian simultaneous-equation model with global and local shrinkage priors, as
    well as a selection procedure to infer the network structure. Prior knowledge on the
    network topology can be incorporated into inference.
